README

Welcome to the Crusaders bot. Let me tell you about what this does and how to use it.

This is a bot for the clicker game Crusaders of the Lost Idols. The idea of this bot is to click
the bottom left crusader and level them up until you run out of money to do so. After this, the bot
will make sure that the toggle progress button is turned on.
When you start the program, you will be asked to input a cycle time. This is how long the bot will
stay idle until it checks if it can level your bottom left crusader and check the toggle progress
button. This time is measured in minutes. It is recommended that you only close the program while
it is idle in one the cycles. Keep in mind that this will take control of your mouse so it is
recommended that you run this while you're not using the computer. 

To get started download the "CrusadersBotFinal.zip", extract it and run the exe. Simple as that.
Hope you enjoy this. Happy clicking
